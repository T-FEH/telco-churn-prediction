# AI Usage in Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project utilized AI assistance to enhance development efficiency and quality. The primary AI tool used was Grok, created by xAI.

## AI Contributions
- **Code Debugging**: Grok assisted in identifying and resolving errors in Python scripts, such as `NotFittedError` in `interpretability.py` and `ValueError` in `train_models.py`, by suggesting fixes like saving fitted preprocessors and ensuring DataFrame column alignment.
- **Code Structure and Best Practices**: Grok provided guidance on structuring `app.py` for the Streamlit app, including caching mechanisms (`@st.cache_data`, `@st.cache_resource`) and file existence checks for robustness.
- **Feature Engineering**: Grok suggested business-driven features like `tenure_bucket`, `services_count`, and `internet_no_tech_support` to improve model performance.
- **Documentation**: Grok helped draft `README.md` and this `AI_USAGE.md` file, ensuring clarity and completeness.
- **General Guidance**: Grok offered step-by-step instructions for setting up the project environment, running scripts, and deploying to Streamlit Community Cloud, tailored to WSL with Fish shell and VS Code.

## Ethical Considerations
AI was used to augment human effort, not replace it. All code and outputs were reviewed and validated by the developer to ensure accuracy and alignment with project goals.
